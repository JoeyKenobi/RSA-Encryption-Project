<h1>RSA Encryption Project<h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a Python program that implements the RSA encryption algorithm based off the parameters described in ISO/IEC 18033-2:2015. This is the current international industry standard for implementing the RSA Algorithm. 

This was a passion project I built in a folder on my college laptop. I pulled the incomplete code from the folder and finally uploaded to Github after cleaning it up. 

The program generates a random prime number, calculates the greatest common divisor, and calculates the modular inverse of a number to generate an RSA key pair - all steps that follow the parameters of section 11.1 RSA Key Generation Algorithms of the document specified above. 

It then takes input text from the user, encrypts that input using the generated key pair, and logs the encrypted text for the user to see.
